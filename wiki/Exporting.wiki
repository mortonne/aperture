eeg_ana supports limited interfacing with other toolboxes:
|| Toolbox     || Common Uses ||
|| EEGLAB      || Useful for visualizing data and running ICA ||
|| Fieldtrip   || Provides advanced statistics ||
|| MVPA        || Provides support for pattern classification ||
|| R || Advanced univariate statistics for making stat maps ||
|| beh_toolbox || Advanced analysis of memory experiments ||
|| eeg_toolbox || Wavelet analysis ||

Use {{{pat2fieldtrip}}} and {{{pat2eeglab}}} to export a pattern object for use with fieldTrip or EEGLAB. The R statistics program can be used to run advanced statistics, through {{{stat_R}}}, which can be used with {{{pattern_statmap}}} to create statistical maps. Pattern classification is run using the Princeton MVPA toolbox; all the pattern classifiers and performance metrics included in that toolbox can be used. eeg_toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox developed by the Kahana lab, which provides a backend for many functions, including reading raw continuous EEG data and calculating power spectra using wavelets. Behavioral Toolbox (beh_toolbox) is a set of functions developed by the Kahana and Polyn labs for analysis of data from memory experiments.
