{"name":"Aperture","tagline":"Matlab toolbox for univariate and multivariate analysis of EEG data in the time and frequency domains","body":"# APERTURE\r\n\r\nAPERTURE is a MATLAB-based toolbox for exploratory analysis of EEG data. It supports both univariate analysis and multivariate pattern analysis, and can process large amounts of data in parallel. It interfaces with R to provide advanced statistics, and includes advanced plotting functions and can generate PDF reports to help with exploratory analysis. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/mortonne/aperture/wiki) for an introduction to using the various capabilities of the toolbox.\r\n\r\nAPERTURE is built on a collection of functions for analyzing scalp EEG and ECoG data developed in the Computational Memory Lab at University of Pennsylvania. The project is currently maintained by the Polyn lab at Vanderbilt University. The toolbox was formerly known as eeg_ana or EEG Analysis Toolbox.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nTo install, add all project subdirectories to your MATLAB path. For\r\nexample:\r\n`addpath(genpath('path_to_eeg_ana'))`\r\n\r\nYou must also install some dependencies, including the\r\n[UPenn Behavioral Toolbox](http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Behavioral_toolbox),\r\nthe UPenn EEG Toolbox, EEGLAB, and the\r\n[Princeton MVPA Toolbox](http://code.google.com/p/princeton-mvpa-toolbox/). It\r\nis recommended that you use the versions of these dependencies that\r\nare available on the Google Code site's\r\n[download page](https://code.google.com/p/eeg-analysis-toolbox/downloads/detail?name=eeg_ana_0.6.0.zip),\r\nin the `external` directory.\r\n\r\nTo use reporting functions that produce PDF reports, you must have LaTeX \r\ninstalled and have latex, pdflatex and dvipdf on your path.\r\n\r\nDistributed computing options require the MATLAB Distributed Computing\r\n Toolbox.\r\n\r\n# Publications using APERTURE\r\n\r\nMorton, N.
