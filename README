EEG_ANA Toolbox
---------------
This is a MATLAB-based toolbox for analysis of EEG data.  The current
project homepage is:

http://code.google.com/p/eeg-analysis-toolbox/

The SVN project used to develop code is currently hosted on a private
server. We plan to move SVN access to the Google code page later.

The toolbox uses functions from the EEG Toolbox developed at the
University of Pennsylvania Computational Memory Lab. Pattern
classification uses the Princeton MVPA toolbox, and much of the internal
organization and user interface is based on the MVPA toolbox. 3D
plotting functions are taken from EEGLAB, and other plotting functions
are based on EEGLAB and fieldTrip functions.

Installation
------------
To install, add all project subdirectories to your MATLAB path. For
example:
addpath(genpath('path_to_eeg_ana'))

You must also install the UPenn eeg_toolbox. The SVN project is at:
svn+ssh://rhino.psych.upenn.edu/home/svn/eeg/eeg_toolbox/branches/unstable

Note that this project uses the "unstable" branch of eeg_toolbox.

Some functions may also depend on the UPenn Behavioral Toolbox:
svn+ssh://rhino.psych.upenn.edu/home/svn/matlab/beh_toolbox/trunk

Pattern classification requires functions from the Princeton MVPA toolbox:
http://code.google.com/p/princeton-mvpa-toolbox/

Add only core/learn and core/util to your path; some of the functions
in the other directories conflict with EEG_ANA functions.

To use reporting functions that produce PDF reports, you must have LaTeX 
installed and have latex, pdflatex and dvipdf on your path.

Distributed computing options require the MATLAB Distributed Computing
 Toolbox.
