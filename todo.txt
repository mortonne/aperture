Stats:
pat_rm_anova: only does 2-way
develop run_classifier-type script that can run various statistics, which can be called by one pat_stats function
should we make run_anovan a serious script?

Plotting:
pat_plots: is there a simpler way?
plot_pow_sig: pick one format for p-values and stick with it, or come with system to deal with different types
also double-check significance color maps
spline files for the new caps!
consider beefing up plot_events.  it's pretty sick and very unique
it'd be nice if the plotting scripts worked.

Patclass
write new classify_pat2pat!
more classifiers, general section to give access to all MVPA functions, Sean's correlation-based classifier

Patterns:
cat_pats can only do the channel dimension
saving as and processing patterns as slices
is expandDim general enough to be included?

Events:
do we need catallevents?

General:
check feasibility of cross-experiment analyses (running Per's SME-serial position interaction analysis on all LTP FR experiments)
user-friendly script to generate basic ERPs for a subject, create PDF report
check reporting scripts for generality
