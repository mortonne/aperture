== General Issues ==
 * documentation needs an update!
 * compatibility with EEGLAB and fieldtrip
  * For right now, throwing in useful functions to whatever folder seems to fit. Should there be a top-level fork between eeg_ana and other toolbox functions to facilitate updates?
 * check feasibility of cross-experiment analyses (running Per's SME-serial position interaction analysis on all LTP FR experiments)
  * possibility: expand merge_exps.m, add 'experiment' field to each subj
 * improve consistency:
  * naming conventions - getobj vs. get_mat
  * input - getobjallsubj takes "path" while getobj takes varargin
  * remove "basic" directory, move all "obj" functions to one directory

== Basic ==
 * make an init_subj function; currently get_sessdirs is the only way to make a subj structure
 * remove init_scalp and init_iEEG, added scripts for adding channel information to existing subjects

== Events ==

== Patclass ==
 * more classifiers, general section to give access to all MVPA functions
 * ANOVA feature selection - see if there is anything we can take from MVPA
 * support for classifying each time-frequency bin separately (could sig scripts be generalized to include this?)

== Patterns ==
 * saving as and processing patterns as slices (post-creation conversion in split_patfile.m. Support in create_pattern.m would be good.)
 * is expandDim general enough to be included? (Need to remember what this was used for).

== Plotting ==
 * fix calling signation of pat_* plotting functions.  The user shouldn't have to worry about create_fig.  Switching the signature may be tricky, since there is no way to ensure backwards compatibility.
 * consider beefing up plot_events.  it's unique and potentially very useful.

== Stats ==
 * bootstrapping/summed z
 * RMAOV
 * permutation test on subject significance
 * cluster statistic

== Utils ==
 * should objfilename.m be used more?
 * consider adding ability for getobj and setobj to get/set multiple objects.
