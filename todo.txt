== General Issues ==
 * what should be included in the toolbox, and what should be user-generated?  For example, should we have a erp+ANOVA+plots with significance script?
 * check feasibility of cross-experiment analyses (running Per's SME-serial position interaction analysis on all LTP FR experiments)
  * possibility: expand merge_exps.m, add 'experiment' field to each subj
 * user-friendly script to generate basic ERPs for a subject, create PDF report
 * check reporting scripts for generality

== Basic ==
 * expand use of "path" cell array-style exp referencing; may make applytosubj more flexible
  * New plan: scripts like apply_to_pat that call apply_to_subj and apply_to_obj.
    We don't need function chaining; just write your own script that calls multiple
    pat-modifications scripts.  More flexibility, less guesswork.

== Events ==

== Patclass ==
 * more classifiers, general section to give access to all MVPA functions
 * support for classifying each time-frequency bin separately (could sig scripts be generalized to include this?)

== Patterns ==
 * remove "eid" standard from pat-modification scripts; just have them throw an error instead.
 * cat_pats can only do the channel dimension
 * saving as and processing patterns as slices (post-creation conversion in split_patfile.m. Support in create_pattern.m would be good.)
 * is expandDim general enough to be included?

== Plotting ==
 * pat_plots: is there a simpler way?
  * General fig-creation script, with function handles for figure making, perhaps?
 * plot_pow_sig: pick one format for p-values and stick with it, or come with system to deal with different types
 * also double-check significance color maps
spline files for the new caps!
 * consider beefing up plot_events.  it's unique and potentially very useful.

== Stats ==
 * should we make run_anovan a serious script? 
  * ANOVA/event-related mean/plotting/report script: sme_erp.m
    needs to be formalized (add in across-subject significance)

== Utils ==
 * should objfilename.m be used more?
 * getobj/setobj/rmobj/recursive_setobj a messy setup. Should just give
   getobj and setobj recursive capabilities.  Also, rmobj is the same as
   recursive_setobj, you just set the object to [].
