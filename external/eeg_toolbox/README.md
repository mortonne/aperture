# Penn EEG Toolbox

The EEG Toolbox was developed at the Kahana Computational Memory Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. A version of the toolbox is available on the lab's [software page](http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Software). Some of the scripts from a more recent version of EEG Toolbox are included here because Aperture depends on them.
