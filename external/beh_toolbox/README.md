# Penn Behavioral Toolbox

The Kahana Computational Memory Lab at the University of Pennsylvania developed a toolbox designed for analysis of behavioral data from free recall experiments. There has been a [public release](http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Behavioral_toolbox) of a version of the toolbox. Some scripts from a more recent version are provided here, since a number of scripts in Aperture depend on them.
